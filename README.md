# Portfolio-Website
# Dynamic MERN Stack Portfolio Website

## üöÄ About The Project

This project was built to serve as a personal space to showcase my development projects. The primary goal was to create a "living" portfolio that could be updated easily and dynamically. Instead of hard-coding each project into the HTML, this application pulls project data from a NoSQL database via a RESTful API. An admin can log in to a protected panel to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the projects.
